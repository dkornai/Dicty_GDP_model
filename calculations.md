## critical cell densities for PSF and CMF sensitivity

cmf and psf are sensed when cell densitites > 10^6/ml (Maeda 2005, Loomis 2014)

- if 1 ml is represented as a 100x100 grid -> 10^4 grid cells in total -> 10^2 cells per grid unit is the critical density. 
  
  - if all quantities are scaled by a factor of 10^-1, this will mean 
    
    - critical cell density is 10^5/ml -> critical grid density is 10/grid unit
