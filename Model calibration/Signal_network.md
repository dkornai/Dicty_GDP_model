# Diffusion and production rates of signalling molecules

### cAMP

produced when the ACA gene is active (Loomis 2014)

- weight: 329g/mol -> 329Da (Wikipedia)

- diffusion coefficient is thus 0.0234 mm2/s

## PSF

Produced continuously in growing cells, production declines rapidly when cells starve (Clarke & Gomer 1995). Sensitivity begins following starvation. 

Sensitivity threshold is at about 10^6 cells/ml

- weight: 87 KDa (Loomis 2014)

- diffusion coefficient is thus 0.0036 mm2/s

- production rate is constant, thus it accumulates in proportion to cell density (Clarke & Gomer 1995)

## CMF

Secretion and sensitivity only following starvation (Loomis 2014)

Threshold for detection is 10ng/ml (Loomis 2014)

- production rate: 12 molecules/cell/min (Yuen & Gomer 1994)

- production rate/cell varies with density, such 150x increase in density incrases rates by 9x

- weight: 80 KDa (Loomis 2014)

- diffusion coefficiant is thus: 0.0037 mm2/s

# Gene regulatory network

starvation+PSF activates YakA

YakA inhibits PufA, and PufA inhibits PKA, thus YakA activates PKA

PKA activates CAR1 and ACA

CAR1 activates ACA, if CMF was sensed

ACA produced cAMP, most of which is exported. 

cAMP activates PKA

## Activation of developmental genes:

- CMF activates the receptor CMFR1, which activates developmental genes (CotB, CprB...) (Loomis 2014)

- cAMP stimulation of CAR1 activates developmental genes (Zhang et al 2004)
