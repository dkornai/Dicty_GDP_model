# Dicty_GDP_model

### Project abstract:


The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has a unique life cycle that requires more than 100000 independent unicellular organisms spread across the soil to aggregate into a single multicellular organism, which is used for the dispersion of spores. This is made difficult by the fact that the independently growing amoeba are genetically nonhomogeneous, and exposed to a large range of microenvironments, which generates significant cell-cell variability (noise), which must be overcome to ensure the synchronized entry of the collection of cells into multicellular development.

The transition from the unicellular lifestyle to multicellular development is controlled by a gene regulatory network called the growth-differentiation pathway (GDP), which integrates information about nutrient concentrations and the starvation status and density of kin in their surroundings to make the decision about entering the multicellular phase.

Following the construction of a Boolean circuit model of the GDP, I first demonstrate that without buffering mechanisms, cell-cell variability will lead to the desynchronization of . To overcome this variation, cell-cell communication with signalling molecules is coupled to positive feedback loops, which enables the robust collective acquisition of cell fates.
